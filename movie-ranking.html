<h1>THE MOST AMAZING GHIBLI MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h1>
 <h2>Ofcourse in my humble opinion.</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
 <p>I think it was very well deserving of the Oscar. I loved Haku and im gonna name my cat after him (that is if i ever have one)</p>
 <h3>Arrietty</h3>
 <p>No ones too big or too small to make a difference fr</p>
 <h3>Howls Moving Castle</h3>
 <p>I would love to live in a house that moves. Man I loved the twist that he knew Sophie since he was young. </p>
